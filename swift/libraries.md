# Libraries
Swift has four main libraries:
1. The Swift main library
2. Foundation (slightly higher level than main lib, with expanded tools and types)
3. Cocoa (specific to macos includes buttons, views, etc. all classes are prefixed with NS. Cocoa includes foundation. import Cocoa)
4. Cocoa Touch (also called UIKit, cocoa for ios. All classes are prefixed with UI. Includes Foundation)

There are also, of course, libraries for apple watch and tv, as well as plenty of 3rd party libraries.
Many libraries prefix their classes with the name of the library:
CoreLocation - CLLocation etc.
