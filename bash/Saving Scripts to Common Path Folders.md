The following folders are commonly on the PATH by default:

* /usr/local/bin
* /usr/bin
* /usr/sbin
* /sbin

Scripts that are intended only for the user installing them should be stored in **/usr/local/bin. **Scripts intended for use by all non system users should be stored in **/usr/bin.** Scripts intended for use by the system user should be installed at **/usr/sbin**. Scripts intended for system wide use and access should be stored at **/sbin**.
