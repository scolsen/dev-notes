Basic method to make a shell script executable

```sh
chmod +x myscipt.sh
```

That’s it! Now your scritp is executable by running `​./myscript.sh`​ in the parent folder containg the script.

To make the script globablly accessible, save it as a file without a suffix, e.g. `​myscript`​ and add it to your `​`​path.
