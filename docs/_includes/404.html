    		The site failed to retrive whatever you were looking for. Perhaps something went wrong. Perhaps there's simply nothing to be found. Either way, you can head back to the home page <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">here.</a>
    		Additionally, you can let me know if something really wonky seems to be going on, or if the site is downright unusable. I'd appreciate it: <a href="mailto:scg.olsen@gmail.com">email me.</a>
