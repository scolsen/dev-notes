# Special Operators

Aside from functions, list contains 25 special operators that look like function forms but have special functionality which a user cannot define. 

*`if`* controls a return value:
`(if test-form then-form else-form)`
`quote` or `'` returns a form without evaluating it:
`'(+ 1 2)` ; returns (+ 1 2) not 3.
